# live-stream-wallpaper
it's interesting to watch city live camera on youtube live stream\
this project allows you to set a youtube live stream as wallpaper\
\
normally you would only able to set gif/video for wallpaper (using wallpaper engine etc)\
this is a python implementation(tkinter) for a wallpaper-engine-like program\
it's binded properly with win32gui background handle so it work perfectly as a wallpaper\
by the time this project created, seems no similar solution found online\
\
#### usage
- install required libraries
- `python main.py`
- enter youtube url without extra params
- use system tray icon to quit
- enjoy
\
reference,\
properly bind with background handle\
